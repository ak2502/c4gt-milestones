## Learnings

- Typescript : TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript, allowing developers to define explicit data types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch errors during development and provides better code documentation.
