## Learnings

- As I explored alternative data storage options, JSON kept popping up in discussions and articles. It struck me as an intriguing choice due to its simplicity and ubiquity in modern programming. To learn more, I decided to experiment with using JSON files as my application's data store. Little did I know that this seemingly simple decision would open up a world of possibilities and teach me valuable lessons about data management in the world of software development.

- One of the most significant realizations was that I didn't need to change my programming language or stack. JSON's versatility allowed me to seamlessly integrate it into my existing codebase. I learned how to serialize and deserialize JSON data, making it easy to work with objects in my preferred programming language. Over time, I expanded my use of JSON to handle user profiles, content storage, and even basic analytics. It was a learning process, but it demonstrated that JSON could be a powerful tool in managing data for smaller-scale applications.
