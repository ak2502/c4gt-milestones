## Milestones
- **Thorough Testing of Translations:** I initiated a comprehensive testing phase encompassing all translations completed up until week 3. During this meticulous review, I identified a previously missed component - the detailed notifications page - and promptly converted it to ensure consistent multilingual coverage.
- **Multilingual Generate Report Page:** Successfully introduced multilingual support for the Generate Report page. Both types of reports, Case Report, and Settlement Agreement, now offer translations for dropdowns, placeholders, and content, enhancing accessibility and comprehension.
- **Multilingual Annual Report Generation:** Extended multilingual capabilities to the Annual Report Generation page. Users can now generate annual reports in their preferred language, further promoting inclusivity and engagement.
