# Project Description

ABDM (Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission) is a pioneering initiative undertaken by the Government of India to establish a robust digital health infrastructure that supports an integrated healthcare ecosystem. This mission aims to bridge existing gaps among various stakeholders in the healthcare sector by establishing digital highways, enabling seamless connectivity and efficient information exchange.

In my project “Discovery and Linking Workflows”, the primary objective is to ensure that patients are easily discoverable within the ABDM ecosystem using their unique ABHA number (Ayushman Bharat Health ID). This unique identifier acts as a key to unlock access to a patient's comprehensive health information.

The entire project can be broken down into these 9 main tasks to be completed in 8 weeks with each task having further sub-tasks to ensure the proper completion of the project:

* Understanding the domain of the project 
* Understanding the problem statement
* Understanding the goals and scopes of this project
* Setting up the Sandbox environment
* Setting up a local dev environment
* Define API contracts
* Develop the required APIs to simplify discovery and linking workflows 
* Comprehensive Testing of the APIs
* Documentation
