## Milestones
- [x] Understanding the problem statement of ABDM - Discovery and Linking Workflows and familiarizing with the tech stack (Spirngboot, Java, NoSQL)
- [x] Comprehensively understand the design flow document of ADBM Wrapper that abstracts the HRP(HIU/HIP) complexities for developers.
- [x] Work on a high-level design structure for the development of HIP, HRP Facade and understanding how to discover new patient data and link the same to the existing workflow. 
- [x] Set up a Springboot Project using Gradle and define the system configuration for the project, effectively manage dependencies and raise a Pull Request. 
- [x] Getting acquainted with the ABDM Sandbox portal and understanding the different methods of user authentication.

- Issue created for the project: https://github.com/atulai-sg/abdm-sdk/issues/6


## Learnings
During the first week of the project, I acquired valuable learning outcomes:
- Gained in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience with the backend tech stack, particularly Springboot. This practical exposure allowed me to understand its implementation and learn various ways to handle dependencies and resolve conflicts effectively.
- Participated in an open-source community, providing me with a unique opportunity to observe and engage in collaborative processes. Witnessing the ideation and collective efforts of the community to create impactful products was truly inspiring and enlightening.
- Received expert guidance during a comprehensive walkthrough of the design document and architecture of ABDM Wrapper from my mentor. Additionally, I actively participated in sync-up meetings for queries and ideation, contributing to the Proof of Concepts (POCs).
- Developed a high-level architecture design document for my backend implementation of HIP Facade. This design ensures that HRP requests relevant responses and appropriately maps the request to subsequent responses.
- Gained proficiency in working with the ABDM Sandbox environment by setting it up locally on my machine. This environment will be crucial in invoking APIs for retrieving patient information and medical history.

The first week proved to be a fruitful and enriching experience, equipping me with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in the Discovery and Linking workflows project, focusing on its backend implementation.
