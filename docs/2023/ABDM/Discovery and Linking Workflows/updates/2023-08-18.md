## Milestones
- [x] Continue the implementation of the service layer for the HRP (Health Repository Provider). This layer plays a pivotal role in making calls to the Wrapper and ABDM to retrieve and invoke patient data and information.
- [x] Test out the implementation of authentication of the user via the Postman channel and create a demo for the same. 
- [x] Running the spring boot application on the 4200 port in debug mode and checking if you are hitting the break-point in the API (care-context/discover) implemented. 
- [x] End to End testing of Discovery APIs (care-context/on-discover and care-context/discover) on Postman. 
- [x] Understanding localtunnel library which looks promising as an alternative for Ngrok.

## Contributions
- Completed and tested Discovery and Linking APIs from ABDM Sandbox on Postman and my local machine - Springboot Application working. 
- Link to PR: https://github.com/atulai-sg/abdm-sdk/pull/16

## Learnings
- Learned and implemented unit testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito which helped me ensure the correctness of my code and its individual components.
- Started working on my midpoint Presentation Feedback to accommodate the changes that have been established in the project so far in a more descriptive manner.
- Started working on the documentation for my work to facilitate the easier handover of the project. 
- Explored the integration of authentication mechanisms with the Postman channel through a practical demo, highlighting the security features of the application.
- Learning the advantages and use cases of using local tunnelling for exposing locally hosted applications to the internet.
- Understanding how to set breakpoints within the API codebase and verifying if they are being hit during API execution.
