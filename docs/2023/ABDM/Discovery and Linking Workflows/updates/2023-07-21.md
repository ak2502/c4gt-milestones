## Milestones
- [x] Understanding the problem statement of ABDM - Discovery and Linking Workflows and familiarizing with the tech stack (Spirngboot, Java, NoSQL)
- [x] Start the design and development of HIP Facade following the ABDM Wrapper documentation and set up a multimodular Gradle Project. 
- [x] Writing code for invoking API for Discovery consisting of Controllers and the Service layer to display the patient data locally on the machine as well as testing on Postman. 
- [x] Learn different types of Unit Testing Frameworks (JUnit, Mockito, etc.) and implement them in the existing API calls. 
- [x] Getting access to the ABDM Sandbox portal and invoking APIs for Discovery and Linking Workflows (Completing the 3-step process of getting access as a PHR user).

## Learnings
During the third week of the project, I acquired valuable learning outcomes:
- Setting up a multimodular Gradle Project taught me the benefits of modularization, making the codebase more maintainable, reusable, and scalable. It also encouraged better organization and separation of concerns. It was an entirely new experience to work in Springboot and learn about the different dependencies we incur while setting up a multimodular project. 
- Participated in an open-source community, providing me with a unique opportunity to observe and engage in collaborative processes. Witnessing the ideation and collective efforts of the community to create impactful products was truly inspiring and enlightening.
- Writing code for invoking APIs for Discovery and testing them using tools like Postman showed me the practical aspect of developing RESTful APIs. I learned how to expose data and functionalities securely, and how to validate and test API endpoints effectively.
- Learned and implemented unit testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito which helped me ensure the correctness of my code and its individual components. Unit testing contributed to robust, bug-free code and aided in maintaining code quality.
- Gaining access to the ABDM Sandbox portal was a challenge due to the multi-tier process. This experience taught me the challenges and considerations involved in working with third-party APIs.
- Gained proficiency in working with the ABDM Sandbox environment by setting it up locally on my machine. This environment will be crucial in invoking APIs for retrieving patient information and medical history.

The third week proved to be a fruitful and enriching experience, equipping me with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in the Discovery and Linking workflows project, focusing on its backend implementation.
