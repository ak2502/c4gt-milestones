## Milestones
- [x] Implement the ABDM APIs specific to "Discovery and Linking Workflows" and handle the output data based on the application's needs.
- [x] Implement the service layer for the HRP (Health Repository Provider). This layer plays a pivotal role in making calls to the Wrapper and ABDM to retrieve and invoke patient data and information.
- [x] ABHA ID Creation, Verification and Generating the Link access token for getting access to ABDM Sandbox. 
- [x] Complete the ABDM APIs in Postman and fetch data in Spring boot (designed the Controllers, Unit test cases using JUnit and Mockito, etc).
- [x] Understand and create the bridge URL tunnel using Ngrok and Webhooks.
- [x] Work on the Midpoint Showcase scheduled on 28th July.

## Learnings
- Learned and implemented unit testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito which helped me ensure the correctness of my code and its individual components.
- Learnt about client and server side communication, Long polling and Short Polling, Synchronous and Asynchronous API.
- Midpoint Presentation feedback: The overall presentation went really well and my reviewer was equally impressed with the presentation and my project progress. Since my project was predominantly backend focused, so it involved a lot of API testing on Postman and making the Controllers and Service layers work for invoking API calls from ABDM Sandbox. One of the feedback I received was to showcase a Before and After Scene Project Demo once it is finished and all changes and things I experimented with. The second feedback I received was to create a basic HTML CSS website/template to showcase the work in the final demo since it is majorly a backend project (on further extending the scope of the project). Overall, the midpoint showcase was a huge success.
