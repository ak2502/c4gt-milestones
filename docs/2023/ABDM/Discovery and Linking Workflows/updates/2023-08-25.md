## Milestones
- [x] Continue the implementation of the HIP. This layer plays a pivotal role in making calls to the Wrapper and ABDM to retrieve and invoke patient data and information.
- [x] Complete the implementation and testing of the APIs and check via localhost channel on Postman. 
- [x] Running the spring boot application on the 4200 port in debug mode and checking if you are hitting the break-point in the API (care-context/discover) implemented. 
- [x] Testing Discovery and Linking APIs using mock HIP created in on the NDHM ERM Portal. 
- [x] Do pair programming for the completion of the HIP facade layer.

## Contributions
- Completed and tested Discovery and Linking APIs from ABDM Sandbox on Postman and my local machine - Springboot Application working. 
- Link to PR: https://github.com/atulai-sg/abdm-sdk/pull/16

## Learnings
- Learned and implemented unit testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito which helped me ensure the correctness of my code and its individual components.
- Started working on the documentation for my work to facilitate the easier handover of the project. 
- Explored the integration of authentication mechanisms with the Postman channel through a practical demo, highlighting the security features of the application.
- Understanding how to set breakpoints within the API codebase and verifying if they are being hit during API execution.
