## Milestones
- [x] Implement the ABDM APIs specific to "Discovery and Linking Workflows" and handle the output data based on the application's needs.
- [x] Continue the implementation of the service layer for the HRP (Health Repository Provider). This layer plays a pivotal role in making calls to the Wrapper and ABDM to retrieve and invoke patient data and information.
- [x] Testing out "Discovery and Linking" APIs using Mock HIP on the ERM portal. 
- [x] Complete the ABDM APIs for linking (User Authentication) in Postman and fetch data on the local machine (designed the Gateway Controllers, Unit test cases using JUnit and Mockito, etc).
- [x] End to End testing of Discovery APIs (care-context/on-discover and care-context/discover) on Postman. 
- [x] Understand and create the bridge URL tunnel using Ngrok and other port-rendering alternatives.

## Contributions
- Completed and tested Discovery and Linking APIs from ABDM Sandbox on Postman and my local machine. 
- Link to PR: https://github.com/atulai-sg/abdm-sdk/pull/7 

## Learnings
- Learned and implemented unit testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito which helped me ensure the correctness of my code and its individual components.
- Started working on my midpoint Presentation Feedback to accommodate the changes that have been established in the project so far in a more descriptive manner.
- Started working on the documentation for my work to facilitate in the easier handover of the project. 
- Learnt and implemented Gateway Controller for calling endpoints of Discovery and Linking in my local machine and addressing any blockers while accessing the patient records.
