## Learnings

- learned how to encode and decode a string so that it can be safely transmitted over the internet. This is important because some characters, such as spaces and ampersands, have special meaning in URLs and can cause problems if they are not encoded.
- learned how to send an encoded string as a parameter in a URL. This is a common way to pass data from a client to a server.
- learned how to style a table and heading for making data easy to read.
