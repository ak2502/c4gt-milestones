# Project Description
- The LOINC India project aims to facilitate the integration of LOINC (Logical 
 Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) into Lab Information Management 
 Systems (LIMS) used by Indian laboratories. LOINC is an international standard 
 for coding diagnostic test results and is widely adopted globally. With the 
 implementation of the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) in India, 
interoperable health records have become crucial, and incorporating LOINC codes 
into LIMS is a significant step towards achieving this goal. 
The project involves creating a web-based tool that provides various features. It 
includes the ability to search for tests in the curated LOINC dataset using Indian 
lab test names and abbreviations. Additionally, an API is developed to allow LMIS 
(Laboratory Management Information System) systems to access the LOINC India 
master data for creating new tests. The tool also supports bulk mapping of lab tests, 
facilitating an interactive process for mapping codes and gathering additional 
information from the labs. Furthermore, the project involves the addition of new 
test aliases to the curated database after the bulk mapping process, allowing 
continuous improvement and refinement of the LOINC India alias list.
