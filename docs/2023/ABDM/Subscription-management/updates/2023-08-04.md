## Milestones
- [x] Tested the subscription APIs on Postman after getting access. 
- [x] ABDM switched recently to new documentation, so I started reading those. A few errors were coming while testing some APIs, so I had to read the new documentation thoroughly and try it on the new ABDM app. 
- [x] Understood the workflow of implementing the facade with the existing APIs in the spring-boot application. 
- [x] Understand and create the bridge URL tunnel using Ngrok and other port-rendering alternatives.

## Learnings
- Learned and implemented unit testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito, which helped me ensure the correctness of my code and its individual components.
- Learnt the implementation of subscription APIs and tested locally.
-  Started working on the documentation for my work to facilitate in the easier handover of the project.
