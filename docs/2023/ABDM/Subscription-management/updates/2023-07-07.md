## Contributions
- PR raised for creation of springboot app with gradle config [https://github.com/atulai-sg/abdm-sdk/pull/11]

## Learnings
During the first week of the project, I acquired valuable learning outcomes:
- Gained in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience with Springboot. This practical exposure allowed me to understand its implementation and learn various ways to handle dependencies and resolve conflicts effectively.
- Received expert guidance during a comprehensive walkthrough of the design document and architecture of ABDM Wrapper from my mentor by actively participating in sync-up meetings for queries and ideation, contributing to the Proof of Concepts (POCs).
- Understood the high-level architecture design document for my backend implementation of HIU Facade. 
- Gained proficiency in working with the ABDM Sandbox environment by setting it up locally on my machine. This environment will be crucial in invoking APIs for retrieving patient information and medical history.
