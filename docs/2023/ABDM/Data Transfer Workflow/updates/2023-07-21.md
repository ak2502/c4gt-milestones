## Milestones
- [x] Creating mock APIs (using RapidAPI) and testing on Postman to understand retrieval of information from the backend and how to map requests to the response on the local machine.
- [x] Get access credentials to the ABDM Sandbox environment from NDHM to invoke specific APIs for HIP and HRP.
- [x] Rigorous testing on postman to understand the flow of API calls in notification flow
- [x] Understanding the current encryption and decryption algorithm used by ABDM for Data Transfer


## Screenshots / Videos 
The mock API result (not pushed in the main project) can be seen where we are retrieving the COVID health data for all countries and linking that with the response on Postman.

## Contributions
- Focused on creating mock APIs for retrieving data from the backend using Rapid API to understand how to invoke APIs in Springboot.  


## Learnings

- I made significant progress in the development process, solidifying my skills in API invocation and data handling within the Spring Boot environment. 
- Gained knowledge about Rest Templates and WebClient, tools that are important for invoking an API in Springboot and worked on creating them for calling external mock APIs in Springboot using Postman explored various online public API.
- Understood and createed the bridge tunnel using the ngrock.
- Understood and implemented the ABDM APIs specific to my use case and handle the output data based on the application needs.
- Understood the working of current  encryption and decryption algorithm used by ABDM.
