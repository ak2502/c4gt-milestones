## Learnings
- Deeply understood the encryption and decryption of ABDM along with key geneartion.
- Gained the knwoledge about ECDH AND AES and its overall working.
- Started learning about Junit as it will be needed in project in future.
- My reviewer suggested that focused on to document the API correctly and do not do mistake in it.Keep it simple    and easy to understand so that other can implement easily.
- He  also suggested to add a few slides in my presentation like current  data workflow and proposed workflow so it will be easy to understand .
