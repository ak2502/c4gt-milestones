# Project Description
A patient needs to provide consent to a facility (HIP) for it to share their health records. NHA's Consent Manager does provide apis which help in managing consents but if we provide mechanisms to store consent on HIP front then the whole process of data transfer along with consents can be simplified.

Features to be implemented
APIs to fetch and store consents
Storage layer for consents and mappings
APIs to provide consents
Service to audit and govern consents
