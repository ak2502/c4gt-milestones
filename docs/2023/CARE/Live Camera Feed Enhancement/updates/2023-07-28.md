    - Remark by super mentor: The frontend part is fine and should be updated with discussion with the team. In the locking asset feature, there should be some exploration made on using locks from the postgresql databse itself as it can be used to lock the transaction and make it atomic. Otherwise there may be conditions of deadlocks or race conditions.
