- [Add home_facility to UserBaseMinimumSerializer #1441](https://github.com/coronasafe/care/pull/1441)
## Learnings

- Improve the List and Detail Serializers requirements, so data that is read only couldn't be updated by the UI.

- One major thing in the CARE project where work is to be done are tests. The test coverage for the existing CARE project is pretty low. 

- I also needed to test for Data Redundancy in API responses and check if the data coming in is not more or less. After a bit of research and brain storming I came up with the idea to test it using Enums.

- Enums helped me maintain that the data being returned from the API response is not more or less and is just perfect. This is extremely helpful and very easy to manage. As the API responses change one only needs to update the Enum.
