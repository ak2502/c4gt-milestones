## Contributions

## Learnings

- Gather the project requirements and get to know better about the CARE project and how it is being deployed in Indian States to automate medical services.

- Understand the data flow of the project and see the process to know where and which data is being used in the frontend.

- I don't have much knowledge about React and its components. So, I brushed up on the basics of Hooks like useState, useEffect, useReducer and Redux and its actions. All these had to be learnt to identify areas in the backend that lead to stale data (**data which was not being used**).
