## Milestones
- [X] Research about methods for creating aar file for the project
- [X] Test out all the available plugins which can generate a fat aar
- [X] Research for other approaches to creating a library
## Screenshots / Videos 

## Contributions
Since this is a library publication project there are no pull requests until a good enough methodology is found and implemented.
## Learnings
All the plugins available for creating fat aar are outdated and therefore either are unable to create a fat-aar due to some API deprecations or the created fat aar's crashes the testing application during runtime due to resource unavailabilty
