## Learnings

Acquired knowledge of creating [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) comments and utilizing the [docdash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docdash) template, while exploring its features and applications. The user-friendly and straightforward approach of this tool enhances code comprehension, resulting in an impressive self-generated documentation website.
