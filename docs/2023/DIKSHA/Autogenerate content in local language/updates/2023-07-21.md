## Learnings

- I explored ECML. ECML stands for Ekstep Content Markup Language. It is used to give creators more flexibility and configurability while creating interactive content. Sunbird ED's learning apps use ECML format for users to consume interactive content, questions, quizzes, etc.
- Played around with Bashini's API and explored the endpoints accordingly.
