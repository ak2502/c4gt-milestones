# Project Description

The development of a UI plugin that seamlessly integrates with the ECML and Upload Editors of
Sunbird ED, enabling users to translate textual content within the platform. The plugin will leverage Bhashini Services for Translation to provide efficient and accurate translations. The key features of the plugin include the ability to input textual content through typing, uploading PDF files, or referring to existing content on the platform. Users will be able to specify source and target languages for translation.
