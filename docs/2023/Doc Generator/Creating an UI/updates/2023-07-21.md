## Learnings
- **Implementing the Landing page:**
During the landing page implementation, I learned the importance of aligning with project goals, prioritizing user needs, and maintaining consistent branding. Additionally, I successfully mastered Next.js for the first time. The landing page now lays the foundation for effective user engagement, and I look forward to continuous improvement based on user feedback and data analysis.
