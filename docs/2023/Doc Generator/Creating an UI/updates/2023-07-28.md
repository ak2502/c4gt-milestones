## Learnings
- **Implementing the Real-time rendering page:**
In this milestone, I learned to implement a real-time document rendering page for better user experience and productivity.
- **Mid-point demo:**
During the mid-point demo, I learned the importance of thorough planning and preparation, effective communication and presentation skills, and the significance of incorporating user feedback. The demo helped identify project successes and challenges, enabling us to adapt and prioritize tasks efficiently. Showcasing the project's value and fostering team collaboration were essential in gaining stakeholder support. Moving forward, the lessons learned from the demo will guide us towards a successful and impactful project completion.
