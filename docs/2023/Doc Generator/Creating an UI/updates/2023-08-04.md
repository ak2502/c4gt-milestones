## Learnings
I successfully transformed a static webpage into an interactive, real-time rendering platform, marking a significant achievement. Currently, the dynamic page captures user input and logs it instantly. With upcoming API integration, this input will seamlessly flow to the API endpoints, enhancing user interaction and paving the way for further innovations.
