## Milestones

- [x] Implement ImageOutputPlugin: Create a module to generate images using the canvas library, customize image content, and save them as image files.
- [x] Update Controller Logic: Integrate image generation into the controller's generateDocument method by adding a condition for the output type 'IMG'.
- [x] Test Image Generation: Rigorously test the image generation process to ensure it produces valid images and handles potential errors gracefully.
- [x] Verify Endpoints: Confirm that the new endpoints for generating images function as intended and return the generated image files as expected.
