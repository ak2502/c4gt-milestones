## Milestones
- [x] Decide what parts of templater should be moved to doc-gen and how
- [x] Define approaches to move the code

## Approach
### Create a new Service in Templater called RenderService
- Render Service will be responsible for rendering the templates and will be used by Doc-Gen.
- Currently the `templateService` is injected into the `templateController` which we were previously using to render the templates by calling them as API's in Doc-Gen.
- Move all the template related code from prior `templateController`  to  `RenderService`.
- RenderService should be independent of the `templateController` and should be able to render the templates without the need of calling them as API's so that it can be used as a library by Doc-Gen.  

## Conclusion
Using the above approach we can move the template related code from Templater to Doc-Gen and make it independent of `PrismaService`. Thereby making it easier for Doc-Gen to use Templater as a library, by simply injecting the `RenderService` into Doc-Gen's `RenderController` and using it to render the templates.
