## Milestones

- [ ] Implement the new npm package in Doc-Gen

## Approach

Successfully tested out the RenderService to see if its able to render the templates and it works as expected. Also declared the types for the RenderService to ensure that the codebase is typesafe when using the RenderService in Doc-Gen.
And Since it works perfectly we can move to packaging it as a npm module to use as standalone code in Doc-Gen in the same way we did for testing.

## Learnings

- How to install a separate npm package in Doc-Gen as a tarball file.
- Creating a separate Nest Module with required dependencies which can easily be injected and used.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Plan out the structure of the codebase for Doc-Gen with respect to the OpenAPI Specification.
- [ ] Start writing functionality in Doc-Gen using this npm package.
