## Milestones
- [ ] Implement the above approach and create a PR for the same

## Approach
Since we need to create a method so that we can use it directly in Doc-Gen, we need to ensure that this method is free of any database dependency so we need to decouple the `PrismaService` from the `RenderService` and make it independent of the `templateController` so that it can be used as a Service in Doc-Gen.

Essentially it will follow a similar flow to the controller in templater but here Doc-Gen will provide its own template so we can easily get rid of the Prismaservice dependency.

## Contributions
Here is the link to the PR: [PR](https://github.com/Samagra-Development/templater/pull/23)

## Learnings
- [x] How to create and use the service in a controller
- [x] Abstracting the PrismaService from the RenderService
- [x] How to use the RenderService in Doc-Gen

## Next Steps
- [ ] locally add Templater as a dependency in Doc-Gen and use the RenderService to render the templates
- [ ] Test the endpoint in Doc-Gen to ensure that it is working as expected
