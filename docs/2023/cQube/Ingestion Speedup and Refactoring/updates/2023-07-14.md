## Contributions

ðŸ§§ [Progress mapper](https://github.com/ChakshuGautam/cQube-ingestion/pull/150)

ðŸ§§ [Implemented Threadpool ](https://github.com/ChakshuGautam/cQube-ingestion/pull/139)

## Learnings

ðŸ’¡ I added a progression mapper that constantly maps the progress once ingest/ingest-data command is called along with the file name ingesting at that particular instance . 

ðŸ’¡ To clear the console log , Implemented nestJS winston logger which stores all the verbose that is been printed on the console to a seperate file , thus increasing the observability .

ðŸ’¡ Delegated few tasks to the threadpool so to make them run parallely and boosting the execution time .
