## Learnings

ðŸ’¡ Updated the test case ticket to include more files to increase the test coverage . Was able to dive deep into the repo , came across various mock-implementations and interfaces created.

ðŸ’¡ I added a new config parameter under the globals section in the config.json file to ensure when ingesting data for datasets, it allows for case insensitivity. Also wrote the unit test case for the same and increased the test coverage.

ðŸ’¡ Received valuable feedback in the mid point demo by supermentor Karan MV, who suggested some modifications to be made under the logger functionality to make the console logs more readable.
