## Milestones
- [x] Working on API script for Text to script model.
- [x] Studying the creation of webhook on glific.

## Learnings
- Glific Webhook feature:
    A webhook is a way for Glific to send notifications to other applications or services. When a certain event occurs in Glific, such as a new message being received, Glific can send a notification to the URL specified in the webhook. The application or service that receives the notification can then take any desired action, such as adding the contact information of the sender to a CRM system or sending an email notification to a team member.
