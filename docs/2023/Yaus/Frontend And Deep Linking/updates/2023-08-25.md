## Learnings
The major highlight of this week has been fixing few critical bugs in the yaus backend and improving the telemetry data captured in the yaus backend. I have also been working with a community volunteer to create a YAUS banner. I have also been working on adding contribution guidelines and a contributions section in YAUS main readme. All in all we are making good progress and i am excited to see how the project turns out to be.
