# Project Description

The project aims to enhance the reporting capabilities of Glific so NGOs can measure the impact of their programs. Currently, the platform utilizes BigQuery and LookerStudio for creating reports. However, setting up these tools requires additional effort and NGOs have expressed the need for more accessible reporting options within the platform.

To address this, an internal dashboard has been deployed as the initial version. The project now focuses on further improving the dashboard by incorporating additional graphs and metrics. These enhancements will enable NGO partners to gain deeper insights from the dashboard and complement the existing functionalities of BigQuery and LookerStudio.

# Project Goals

- Include additional graphs to provide an overview of the organization's chatbot performance.
- Add the ability to export data from the dashboard.
- Implement periodic data sending via email to the organization, allowing customization for daily, weekly, monthly, or a combination of these intervals. Multiple email addresses can be set up to receive the data.
- Replicate useful graphs from the LookerStudio template into the internal dashboard.
