## Milestones

🟢 Worked on sorting the flows page 
🟢 Added functionality to send mail to multiple emails in same team

## Contributions

🏅 [Flow Sort](https://github.com/glific/glific/pull/3024)
🏅 [Mails](https://github.com/glific/glific/pull/3042)

## Learnings

🎯 The flows issue was more challenging than I expected, but it helped me to learn a lot about how data flows through a system. I learned how to identify and fix bottlenecks in the flow, and I also learned how to improve the overall performance of the system.

🎯 In the mails issue, I debugged some of the code that I had previously written. This helped me to improve my debugging skills, and it also helped me to learn more about how test cases are used to verify the correctness of code.
