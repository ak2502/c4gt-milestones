## Learnings

游꿢 Milestone 1: Set up Glific on my local environment

I installed the necessary dependencies and tools for local development. I cloned the Glific repository from the version control system to my local machine. I verified that Glific is running correctly on my local machine.

游꿢 Milestone 2: Identify and address issues faced

I thoroughly explored the Glific application and its documentation to understand its structure and functionality. I started using Glific locally and tested various features and functionalities.

游꿢 Milestone 3: Update the README file

I reviewed the existing README file in the Glific repository. I identified areas where the README could be improved to provide clearer instructions, troubleshooting steps, or additional information.

游꿢 Milestone 4: Create a pull request (PR)

I committed the changes made to the README file to the branch. I engaged in discussions and addressed any feedback or comments on the pull request.
