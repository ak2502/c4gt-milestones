## Learnings

🎯 Implemented Google Cloud Console.

🎯 Worked in mailer.ex to send emails to respective teams. The recent migration brought about a significant addition to the organization table, introducing a new field called "team_emails." This addition holds immense importance as it paves the way for an enhanced data infrastructure, capable of accommodating a wider array of critical information essential for the organization's seamless functioning. Specifically, the "team_emails" field has been designed to house a collection of email addresses linked to the different teams operating within the organization.
