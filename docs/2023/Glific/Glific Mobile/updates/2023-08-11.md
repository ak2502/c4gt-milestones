## Learnings

As we approach the culmination of the project, which was initially planned a month ago, I dedicated this week to enhancing the codebase. I focused on refining code structure, writing comprehensive tests, and transforming the code into a more modular and component-oriented design. This experience provided me with valuable insights into maintaining a project's codebase and the significance of clear and instructive comments for future developers.
