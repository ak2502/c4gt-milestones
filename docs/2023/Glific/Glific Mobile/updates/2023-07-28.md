## Learnings

During this week, on July 29th, I have my C4GT project's Mid-Point Showcase. It was an enriching experience as I received valuable feedback from supermentor. I plan to incorporate all feedback to enhance my skills and make further contributions. Additionally, I had the opportunity to observe the presentations of other C4GT projects, which provided valuable insights.

In terms of project-specific learning, this week mainly focused on bug fixing, so there were no significant new learning experiences in that regard. Nevertheless, the feedback and exposure to other projects have been beneficial for my overall growth and understanding in this learning journey.
