## Contributions
- [ ] Create a new request in Postman and set the appropriate HTTP method (e.g., POST or GET) For Text To Speech Translation based on the API documentation.
- [ ] Implement a service inside the library that interacts with the Text-to-Speech Translation API. This service should handle API calls and speech synthesis based on the received text.
- [ ] The users of the library can set the Service_ID in their Angular application by calling a configuration function or through environment variables.

## Learnings
Learn to Integrate audio features into my  Angular application that  can be a valuable learning experience, providing me practical knowledge of handling media elements, working with user interactions, and enhancing user experience through audio features.

We call Two api together one is responsible for Text to text translation and other is text to speech translation so I learn various methods, such as using forkJoin, combineLatest, or merge from RxJS, or using async and await with Promise.all.
