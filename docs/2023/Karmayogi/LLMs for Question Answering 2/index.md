# Project Summary
This project revolves around harnessing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct an efficient question-answering system. These LLMs, advanced deep-learning models, possess the ability to comprehend and generate human-like text. By utilizing content extracted from our documents and inputting it into these models, we can revolutionize our interaction with data. Through this implementation, we can extract textual information from documents and directly pose questions to obtain insightful answers.

# Objectives
The central aim of this project is to comprehensively evaluate various Large Language Models for their effectiveness in addressing the question-answering task. This project will involve creating a well-structured pipeline that facilitates the extraction of the top-n relevant documents from a vector database. These documents will be selected based on their similarity to user queries. The extracted documents will then serve as context for the Large Language Models, enabling them to generate accurate answers. By achieving these objectives, the project aims to elevate the efficiency and accessibility of information retrieval and utilization.
