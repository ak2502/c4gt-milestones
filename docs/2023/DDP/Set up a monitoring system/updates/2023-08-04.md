## Learnings
1. Configuring Grafana for monitoring requires integrating it with the Django application's metrics endpoint to collect and visualize data effectively.
2. Monitoring average response time for HTTP requests provides crucial insights into the application's performance and user experience.
3. Creating well-organized and informative dashboards is essential for effectively communicating key metrics and trends to the development team.
4. Documenting the configuration and dashboard setup ensures that the monitoring process can be replicated, maintained, and improved in the future.
