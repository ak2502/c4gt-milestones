## Learnings

My learnings for this week are as follows.

- Learned about kafka and its applications.

The super-mentor had following suggestions

- To use combination of Redis and files as database as opposed to PostgreSQL as the application is read heavy
- Storing of data in JSON tree to make it easier to query.
- Evaluating the need for some things like kafka.
