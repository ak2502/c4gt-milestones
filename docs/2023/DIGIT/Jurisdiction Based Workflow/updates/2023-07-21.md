## Milestones

- [x] Code analysis to figure out where the flow

  Did the code analysis to identify which parts of the code will require a change.
  Analysis for one of the Use cases in Property Tax Application Process - When the "Take Action" button is clicked and the list of employees is returned it makes a POST call to the HRMSService API which then calls EmployeeService and finally the UserService where the SELECT query filters based on the role & city( TenantID). The API call sends the City(Ward) in the RequestBody of the URL which can also be added in the filtering.

## Screenshots / Videos

- Inspecting the API calls from staging environment front end
  The endpoint path - /egov-hrms/employees/_search?tenantId=pg.cityb&roles=CITIZEN,PT_CEMP,SYSTEM_PAYMENT,SYSTEM&isActive=true&_=1690387714195
  So here in tenantId pb.city2, city2 is the ward-level
