## Learnings
- Learnt about the Hive package in Flutter and how to use it for storing data in the local storage.
- We also had our mid term evaluation this week. I am adding a url for my [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14R5f74QSQyk7kSwnz76qeoqgeele0luPQxWma6927pM/edit?usp=sharing).
- The Super Mentor gave me some feedback where he asked me to look for any race condition in the tracking feature and remove it or try to reduce it. Other than that, he asked me to check the app and its features on iOS as well.
