## Learnings

- Spring Security is a comprehensive Java framework that streamlines the implementation of authentication, authorization, and security features in applications, ensuring controlled access to resources and protecting against unauthorized access.

- The Gluu Server is an open-source identity and access management platform that offers authentication, single sign-on, and secure authorization services, enabling organizations to enhance security and user experience across applications.

- JOSSO is a Java-based open-source framework designed for implementing single sign-on solutions, enabling users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials and simplifying authentication processes.

- CAS is a widely-used single sign-on protocol and framework that offers centralized authentication and seamless access to multiple applications, enhancing user convenience and maintaining security across diverse systems.
