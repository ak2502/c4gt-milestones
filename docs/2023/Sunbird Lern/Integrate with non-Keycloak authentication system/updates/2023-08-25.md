## Milestones

- &#x2611; Integration with Sample Applications:

- &#x2192; Integrate each of the researched security libraries (Spring Security, Gluu Server, JOSSO, CAS) with sample applications representing different use cases and technologies (e.g., Java web application, Spring Boot app, etc.).
- &#x2192; Ensure that the authentication and authorization mechanisms work seamlessly with these sample applications.
- &#x2192; Test various scenarios such as user registration, login, password recovery, and role-based access control.

- &#x2611; Comparison and Performance Analysis:

- &#x2192; Conduct a detailed comparison of the performance, scalability, and resource utilization of each security library in real-world scenarios.
- &#x2192; Measure response times, resource consumption, and system stability under different levels of load and traffic.
- &#x2192; Document the findings in terms of performance benchmarks and guidelines for selecting the appropriate library based on specific project requirements.

- &#x2611; Customization and Extensibility Exploration:

- &#x2192; Explore the customization and extensibility options offered by each security library to adapt them to unique business needs.
- &#x2192; Investigate how easily each library can be extended to support custom authentication providers, user stores, or integration with existing identity systems.
- &#x2192; Develop and demonstrate custom extensions or plugins that enhance the capabilities of the security libraries beyond their out-of-the-box features.

## Learnings

- Throughout the process of integrating the different security libraries (Spring Security, Gluu Server, JOSSO, CAS) with various sample applications, it became apparent that each library offers a trade-off between integration complexity and flexibility. While Spring Security provides extensive customization options and supports a wide range of application types, it might require more effort to set up and configure. On the other hand, Gluu Server and JOSSO simplify integration by providing standardized protocols like OpenID Connect and SAML, but they might have limitations in terms of customization. CAS demonstrated a balance between ease of integration and flexibility by offering a modular architecture that can adapt to diverse requirements.

- During the comparison and performance analysis phase, it became evident that the performance and scalability of the security libraries vary based on the use case and deployment environment. Spring Security showed robust performance in various scenarios, especially when fine-tuned for specific requirements. Gluu Server excelled in scenarios where OpenID Connect and OAuth2 flows were a natural fit, providing secure authentication and authorization at scale. JOSSO's lightweight approach worked well for certain simpler setups but might require more effort to optimize for high traffic scenarios. CAS showcased strong performance due to its modular design, enabling the selection of components based on the application's needs. The analysis highlighted the importance of aligning the security library's strengths with the project's performance requirements.
