## Learnings
This week I gained a comprehensive understanding of Dynamic Mocking in Wiremock and its practical implementation. I delved into the intricacies of the APIs offered by various services, as well as the corresponding data models they employ. This included a meticulous analysis of integration points to ascertain the most suitable approach.

I initiated the process by focusing on the Mocking of the UserOrg Service, a critical integration point. This endeavor commenced after a thorough comprehension of the API endpoints and their functionalities. An important aspect of this project involved adeptly managing data input and output formats, thereby ensuring seamless transformations.

Furthermore, I successfully Wiremocked several functions in accordance with the established specifications. This process demanded a high level of attention to detail, in order to seamlessly integrate the APIs and their corresponding specifications.
