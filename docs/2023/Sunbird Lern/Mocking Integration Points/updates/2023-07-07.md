## Learnings

During the first week, I focused on understanding the project requirements thoroughly. This step was crucial to set a clear direction for my work. I also dedicated time to grasp the intricacies of the existing [Batch Service](https://lern.sunbird.org/learn/product-and-developer-guide/batch-service), studying its functionality, architecture, and components.

One of the significant tasks during this week was searching and deciding on a suitable framework for mocking. I explored various options and made an informed decision based on the project's needs. This choice would streamline testing and development in the subsequent stages.

To get started with development, I set up my development environment, ensuring everything was in place. This involved configuring databases like Cassandra, ElasticSearch, and Redis, as well as setting up Ubuntu and IntelliJ for smooth development.
