# Project Description
- User account creation and management, user login as well as platform administration capabilities is powered by the User-Org Service of Sunbird Lern Building Block.

- This component enables the users to create accounts to save their platform preferences, access relevant content based on their preferences etc. Users with accounts on the system who login also get access to richer platform features such as Courses and Learner passbook.
- Platform administrators can be granted capabilities to manage user roles on the platform, as well as manage platform master data (eg. Location data, Framework values etc.)

- Configure the platform to allow for user logins via various mechanisms including username/ password, Google login or single sign-on with other approved systems.
