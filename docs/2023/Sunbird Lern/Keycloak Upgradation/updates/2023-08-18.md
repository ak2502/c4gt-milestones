## Contributions

## Learnings
- **Setting and Managing Jenkins:**
Docker provides an isolated environment for Jenkins, making it easy to package Jenkins along with its dependencies. This approach simplifies installation and configuration, ensures consistent behavior across different environments, and simplifies scaling.

- **Configuring Jenkins for different types of projects:**
Setting up a Jenkins pipeline for upgrading Keycloak involves creating a Jenkinsfile that describes the entire upgrade process. We need to define stages like "Backup," "Data Migration," "Testing," and "Deployment." Within each stage, we can specify steps such as running shell scripts, executing commands, and invoking plugins.

- **Creating a Data Migration Script for Keycloak Upgrade:**
Creating a data migration script involves analyzing the differences in the database schema, configurations, and data structures between Keycloak version 7 and 12. The script should encompass steps to back up the existing data, transform data to match the new schema, update configurations, and ensure data consistency. Learning about database schema evolution, SQL scripting, and version-specific differences in Keycloak's database structure is important.
