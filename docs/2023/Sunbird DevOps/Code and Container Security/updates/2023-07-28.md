Supermentor Feedback - 

1. Deciding the phase in the pipeline of when the scanning should be performed - pereferably during the image building in the jenkins, before it is pushed / deployed.
2. Providing more integrated and informational reports of the vulnerabilities involed, so that more context is visible regarding fixing it.
