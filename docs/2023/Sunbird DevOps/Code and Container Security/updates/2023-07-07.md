## Learnings

1. Encountered various errors while setting up the SunbirdEd-Portal repository locally.
Most of them were related to the node version - just using Node 16.20.1 fixed nearly all of them.

2. Another error was related to "Reached Heap limit allocation" - this was fixed by increasing the heap memory allocation for Node (setting --max_old_space=8096)
