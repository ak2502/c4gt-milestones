## Learnings
- During setting up the development workspace for testing Beckn APIs, I learned about the following technologies:

- BeckN Sandbox - The BeckN Sandbox is a safe and controlled environment where developers can test and experiment with BeckN Protocol and related applications, identifying and resolving issues before implementing them in real-world settings, ensuring smooth and reliable functionality.

- Swagger - Swagger is an open source set of rules, specifications and tools for developing and describing RESTful APIs. The Swagger framework allows developers to create interactive, machine and human-readable API documentation.

- Postman - Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs faster.

- MongoDB - MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.

- Beckn Registry - A registry system for using Beckn, where one can register their BAP and BPP clients or networks.
