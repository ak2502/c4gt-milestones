<!-- ## Contributions -->

## Learnings
- I learned about the Beckn Protocols and its ecosystem, few of the key points are listed below:

- BeckN Protocol: Beckn Protocol is a set of specifications consisting of APIs, data models, reference architecture, transaction mechanisms, and global standards that when adopted by digital platforms, enable the creation of decentralized networks.

- Open API: An Open API, or public API, is a set of rules that enable different software applications to communicate and share data, fostering integration, innovation, and collaboration across various industries.

- BeckN Sandbox: The BeckN Sandbox is a safe and controlled environment where developers can test and experiment with BeckN Protocol and related applications, identifying and resolving issues before implementing them in real-world settings, ensuring smooth and reliable functionality.
