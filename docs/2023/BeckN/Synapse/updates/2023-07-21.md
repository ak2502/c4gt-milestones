## Learnings
- During setting up the development workspace for testing Beckn APIs, I learned about the following technologies:

- Node Js - Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. I developed a deeper understanding of it, by analysing why to use it for creating the server-side of the seller dashboard.

- React - React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. I delved deep into the components use-case of React to develop similar and repetitive part of the web app.

- User Workflows - I learned about the basic user workflow by analysing the user jouring of the seller dashboard to be developed.
