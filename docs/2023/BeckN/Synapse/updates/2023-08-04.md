## Learnings
- Node Js - Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. I developed a deeper understanding of it, by analysing why to use it for creating the server-side of the seller dashboard.

- Mongoose & its schema - Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. Mongoose provides a way to define the structure of your data using JavaScript objects, known as schemas. A schema in Mongoose defines the shape and characteristics of documents that will be stored in a MongoDB collection. It enforces a structure for your data, allowing you to define the fields, types, validation rules, and default values for documents.

- User Workflows - I learned about the basic user workflow by analysing the user jouring of the seller dashboard to be developed.
