## Learnings
Building a React.js application and connecting it with the backend using Node.js was a rewarding experience. It provided me with a better understanding of how applications interact with open protocol specifications like Beckn. The module that was created to successfully send the ratings given by the users helped me grasp the functioning of various other modules like search, select, confirm, and status in different domains such as mobility, local retail, and logistics.
