## Learnings

In this PR, I successfully implemented the frontend design, enhancing user experience through the integration of components such as Dashboard, API Keys, SDKs, Plugins, and a Wizard. Key achievements include interactive data visualization in the Dashboard, streamlined API Keys management, and a user-friendly interface for SDK integration. Moreover, an intuitive Plugins section was developed for enhanced customization and a guided Wizard simplifies the setup process. Rigorous testing ensured responsive design across devices. Going forward, I plan to enrich functionality through backend integration, aiming to elevate overall performance. Your valuable insights and feedback are greatly appreciated.
