## Learnings

This PR addresses the issue related to implementing the frontend UI design for the Beckn-In-A-Box (BIAB) project. The aim of this implementation is to provide a user-friendly and intuitive UI that simplifies the configuration and build processes for beckn-enabled applications. The UI design is based on the provided wireframes and design concepts, aligned with the overall project vision and existing components. Going forward, I plan to enrich functionality through backend integration, aiming to elevate overall performance. Your valuable insights and feedback are greatly appreciated.
