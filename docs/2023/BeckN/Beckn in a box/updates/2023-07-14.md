## Learnings
- Setting up my Sandbox and protocol server helped me to understand better at a root level.
- I gained a better understanding of how the request flows from the BAP client -> BAP Network -> BeckN Gateway -> BPP client -> BPP Network -> Webhook -> Sandbox.
- While learning and working with different API calls, I understood how the backend works for different requests.
- It provided me with a thorough understanding of the setup.
