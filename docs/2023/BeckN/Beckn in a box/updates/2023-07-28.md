## Learnings
BeckN in a box is not just a modular framework that simplifies participation in the BeckN network. It also comprises various BAP and BPP applications that facilitate communication. The project should also focus on the dynamic aspects of the system. It includes information on how participants can act as consumers or sellers on the network.
