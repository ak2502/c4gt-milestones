- [Decentralized Energy Transaction Protocol (DENT)](https://github.com/beckn/DENT-Protocol)
- The Beckn Energy Interface is an API that emulates the behavior of an Open Energy Network like the Unified Energy Interface.
- DENT Protocol (or simply DENT) enables the creation of a decentralized / federated network of platforms that perform interoperable commercial transactions that result in the transfer of energy from a energy producer to an energy provider.
