# Project Description
- [Project Ticket](https://github.com/beckn/DENT-Protocol/issues/1)
- The Beckn Energy Interface is an API that emulates the behavior of an Open Energy Network like the Unified Energy Interface. 
- BAPs can build rich, integrated experiences by combining services offered by multiple BPPs on the network. 
- BPPs can build complex products by analyzing the nature of input from multiple BAPs. 
- This is an important step in the setup and expansion of open networks. 
- Businesses can test their implementations for protocol compliance by plugging into this sandbox.
