## Learnings
- [PPT link of Midpoint demo](https://gamma.app/public/The-Beckn-QR-Project-Enabling-Interoperability-on-Beckn-Networks-qvjz0cocbqqpkcw)
- [ ]  I learned that QR-codes in the BeckN Protocol can serve a wide range of functionalities beyond basic information storage. They can be used for registration, authentication, and providing detailed information about items in shops.
- [ ] The reviewer's guidance made me realize the importance of focusing on the "discovery" aspect. QR-codes act as entry points to various services, enabling users to explore and engage with the BeckN ecosystem more effectively.
- [ ] Learnt to see the entire project in a different angle ie; Scanning QR-codes eliminates the need for manual data entry and simplifies complex processes, leading to a more user-friendly experience overall.
