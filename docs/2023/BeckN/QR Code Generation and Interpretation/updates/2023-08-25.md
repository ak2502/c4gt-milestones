## Learnings

During Week 8, I gained valuable insights and learnings while working on the project. Here are some of the key takeaways:

1. **User Interface Optimization**:
   I learned the importance of optimizing the user interface to provide a more tailored experience for users. This skill will be beneficial for creating user-friendly interfaces in future projects.

2. **Interpretation Platform**:
   Developing the interpretation platform taught me about integrating QR code scanning functionality and enhancing user interaction.

3. **Cart Functionality**:
   Implementing the "add to cart" functionality for service provider items deepened my understanding of e-commerce features. This knowledge can be applied to various online shopping platforms.
