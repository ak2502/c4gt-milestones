## Learnings
During the implementation of the API workflows of the beckn-enabled web-app and testing the Beckn sandbox APIs using Postman, I gained valuable insights into the power and potential of the beckn protocol. One of the key learnings was the seamless interoperability between different services and platforms that the beckn standard offers. It allows easy integration and communication between various vendors, enabling a rich ecosystem of services for end-users. Additionally, the sandbox environment provided an excellent playground for testing the API workflow, ensuring a smooth and error-free experience for users once the app goes live. Understanding the beckn protocol and successfully implementing it in the web-app has opened up new possibilities for creating innovative, interconnected, and user-friendly applications in the future.
