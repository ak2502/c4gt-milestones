## Learnings
I have learned that an initial approach to a problem may not always be the best. After gaining a deeper understanding of the problem and testing different implementations, we may discover that there are intricacies and limitations to our initial approach. Therefore, it is important to be open and flexible in our thinking and to be willing to explore different approaches to solving a problem.
