## Contributions

- Integrated ESLint and Prettier into the development workflow, guaranteeing consistent code style across the team, reducing code review friction, and promoting codebase maintainability.
- Implemented Husky's pre-commit and pre-push hooks to enforce linting and formatting standards on code changes, fostering a culture of code quality and reliability.

## Learnings

- Gained insights into the power of Husky hooks to automate code quality checks, ensuring code hygiene and reducing the likelihood of bugs or regressions slipping into the codebase.
- Embraced the significance of ESLint and Prettier in maintaining a consistent code style, enabling efficient collaboration among team members and facilitating codebase understanding
