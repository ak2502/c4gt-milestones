## Contributions

- Proposed an idea for setting up the store in redux 
- Published npm package to reduce the lines of code in the application 

## Learnings

My learnings revolved around exploring Redux Toolkit and it's advance features such as RTK Queriers, Slices, Store and Extra Reducers. I also published a planned socket package on npm, which will be used in the application to make the socket part of the application more scalable and modular. I also wrote an article this week on the git commands that I use frequently, which is published on Hashnode.
