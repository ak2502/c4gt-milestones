## Contributions
- Published a dummy package on npm for testing purposes for further refactoring of code 
- Removed redundant instances of window.android instances
- Added new files for socket connections and for getting all the bot list items, for seperation of concerns 
- Filtered the bot items based on the timestamp 
- Raised a PR for this week and last week's work 


## Learnings
 Learned how to publish an npm package in typescript ( NPM is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js ), understood and implemented the useMemo hook react for avoiding re-rendering of the components and also used Moment library for filtering out the outdated bots
