## Contributions

I contributed to the building of the redux store and optimizing code for the fetching messages and botlist fetching, so now we have a single state from where we can access for messages and botlist. I also merged all the branches indpenedently to a common branch to a single c4gt_prod_development branch for further testing


## Learnings

 I discovered Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk, a powerful tool for handling async operations by auto-generating action types. I delved into createSlice, which seamlessly sets up state and reducers, and was particularly intrigued by how extraReducers lets me address actions outside my defined slices, granting me more control over store updates.
