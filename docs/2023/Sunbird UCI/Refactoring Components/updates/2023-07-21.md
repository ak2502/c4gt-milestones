## Contributions
 
- Proposed a socket pacakge for making a socket part of the application scalable 
- Wrote a class based component for making the code more modular and scalable
- Planning to make add redux store to the application 

## Learnings
Recently delved into the concept of mono repos, like Turborepo, which promote modular and scalable projects. Additionally, I grasped the significance of implementing Redux store to enhance application scalability and modularity, ensuring efficient state management and maintainability.
