## Milestones

- üõ† Creation of a dynamic structure for the Form API in Sunbird Ed involves developing a flexible architecture that can adapt and modify its structure based on the fields provided by users or developers.
- ‚≠ê Crafting a mock npm package in Angular and publishing it to npm involves crafting a simulated package that emulates specific functionalities, designing the package's code and structure, integrating it into an Angular project to ensure compatibility, and testing its behavior.

## Learnings

- From the process of creating a mock npm package in Angular and publishing it to npm, I've learned that building and sharing reusable code involves several important steps. First, it's essential to clearly define the purpose and functionalities of the package. Proper design and structuring of the code and also testing of the package's.
- I've also learned how to designing a dynamic Form API structure as per Sunbird Ed involves creating a flexible architecture that adapts to user-provided fields and why it necessitates a system that interprets diverse inputs, generates corresponding form structures.
