## Milestones

- **Responsiveness:** The project now features a responsive design, meaning it adapts and displays appropriately across different devices and screen sizes. Users can access the platform on various devices like desktops, tablets, and smartphones without compromising the user experience.

- **Filtering Algorithm:** Implemented the filtering algorithm, which likely allows users to sort and search for specific educational content, courses, or resources. This enhancement improves the overall user experience by making it easier to find relevant material efficiently.

- **Result Card Layout:** A result card layout has been introduced, most likely for displaying search results or course listings. This layout likely presents information in a visually appealing and concise manner, making it easier for users to scan and select desired items.

- **Proper Rendering of Images, Content, and Tags:** The project now ensures that images, content, and tags are rendered correctly on the platform. This means that visual elements, textual content, and metadata associated with educational resources are displayed accurately and in a user-friendly manner.

## Looking Ahead

- **Filtering Package for Angular :** We planning to implement the filtering package for Angular language and made compatible for the sunbird Ed project.
- **Card Fields Management :** We are planning to implement the card fields management that user can select which he/she want to show or not.
