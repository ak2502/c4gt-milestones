## Learnings

- About Angular npm packages, how the npm packages in angular works and extend the Angular functionality by creating Angular libraries.Exposing a functionality to third party and so on... In these cases its best to create NPM library with just the functionality to be shared.

  - [Creating Libraries](https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries)
  - [Publishing To NPM](https://dev.to/vishesh/creating-new-angular-library-and-publishing-it-in-npm-5f3g)

- How the Form APIs offer essential functionalities for managing forms. Developers can create, update, and view form structures, field types, validations, and behaviors efficiently. These APIs empower developers to build dynamic form systems, customizing data collection and processing for various use cases within their applications.
