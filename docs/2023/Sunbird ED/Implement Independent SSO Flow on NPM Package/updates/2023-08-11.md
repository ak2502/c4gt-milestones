## Milestones
-  🌟 Milestone Focus: NPM Package Integration and Documentation

🚀 Milestone Overview: During this significant milestone, I'm dedicated to two core aspects:

1. NPM Package Integration: 📦 As a part of the Sunbird Ed Portal's enhancement, I'm actively integrating an NPM package that seamlessly augments the codebase, enriching the portal's functionalities.

2. Documentation Enhancement: 📚 Complementing the code integration, I'm committed to enhancing the documentation. By providing clear, comprehensive, and user-friendly guides, I'm ensuring seamless onboarding and usage of the newly integrated features.
