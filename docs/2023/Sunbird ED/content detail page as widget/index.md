# Project Description
The project's objective is to convert the existing content detail page in Sunbird into a self-contained and independent widget. Currently, the content detail page provides comprehensive information about learning materials, resources, and educational content.
The widget will be designed to operate independently, functioning within different environments and frameworks. By making the content detail page a widget, it becomes a reusable component that can be embedded in diverse contexts, such as learning management systems, educational portals, or content authoring tools.
