# Project Description

The project aims to develop a user interface for the Template Creation Portal using Angular, enabling users to engage in planned and trackable micro-improvements. Currently, program/project templates are created using Excel spreadsheets, leading to limitations in user-friendliness and the need for manual intervention. By building a configurable user interface aligned with PWA (Ionic), the project seeks to generate solutions compliant with these templates and streamline the process.
