## Learnings

- FormGroup and FormControl

In Angular, ```FormGroup``` and ```FormControl``` are essential classes from the ```@angular/forms``` module that help you manage and work with forms in a more organized and structured manner.

1. FormControl:
A FormControl represents a single input field within a form. It encapsulates the state and validation logic for that specific input. You create instances of FormControl for each input element in your form.


```
import { FormControl } from '@angular/forms';

const nameControl = new FormControl('initial value');
```


    You can then bind this FormControl instance to your template's input element using Angular's two-way data binding syntax ([(ngModel)] or reactive forms bindings).

2. FormGroup:
A FormGroup is a collection of FormControl instances organized into a single group. It's used to manage a group of related form controls, often representing a larger form with multiple fields.

```
import { FormGroup, FormControl } from '@angular/forms';

const userForm = new FormGroup({
  name: new FormControl(''),
  email: new FormControl(''),
  // ...other form controls
});
```

    You can use this FormGroup to manage the validation, submission, and synchronization of values across the controls within the group.




Both FormControl and FormGroup provide methods for validation, value changes, status checks (like pristine, dirty, valid, invalid), and more. They are a part of the larger Angular Forms ecosystem that provides a way to manage forms in both template-driven and reactive approaches.

Template-Driven Approach:
In the template-driven approach, you use directives like ngModel to create forms. Angular automatically creates and manages FormControl instances under the hood based on your template. However, you can still access and manipulate these controls programmatically if needed.

Reactive Approach (Recommended):
In the reactive approach, you explicitly define the form structure using FormControl and FormGroup instances in your component code. This approach provides more control and flexibility, making it easier to handle complex forms and validations. It's often recommended for larger and more dynamic forms.

In summary, FormGroup and FormControl are fundamental building blocks for managing forms in Angular applications. They help you create, validate, and handle user input effectively, whether you're using the template-driven approach or the reactive approach.
