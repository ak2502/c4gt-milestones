## Learnings

- **Creating Excel Files in Angular:**

1. Install Dependencies: Use npm or yarn to install necessary packages like xlsx for Excel file manipulation.

2. Component Setup: Create an Angular component where you'll generate and preview Excel files.

3. Generate Excel Data: Prepare your data in a format that you want to export to Excel. You can use TypeScript classes or JSON objects.

4. Excel Library: Choose a library like xlsx to create Excel files. These libraries provide methods for creating workbooks, worksheets, and adding data.

5. Create Workbook: Use the chosen library to create a workbook and add worksheets with your data.

6. Styling and Formatting: You can format cells, add styles, and apply formatting options using the library's features.

7. Export Excel: Export the generated workbook to a file format like .xlsx using library functions.

- **Previewing Excel Files in Angular:**

1. File Viewer Component: Create a separate component to display or preview Excel files within your Angular application.

2. File Upload: Implement a file upload mechanism using Angular forms or a file input element to allow users to select Excel files for preview.

3. Reading Excel Data: Use a library like xlsx to read and parse the selected Excel file's data. Extract the necessary information to display in the viewer.

4. Displaying Data: Render the extracted data in the viewer component. You can use HTML and CSS to structure and style the preview.

5. Error Handling: Implement error handling for scenarios where the uploaded file isn't a valid Excel file or if there are parsing issues.

6. Pagination and Navigation: Depending on the complexity of the Excel data, consider adding pagination or navigation controls for better user experience.

7. Download Option: Provide an option to download the uploaded Excel file or an edited version if required.

8. Testing: Thoroughly test your preview component with various Excel file formats and sizes to ensure it works reliably.

9. Security: Be mindful of security concerns when handling file uploads and parsing. Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
