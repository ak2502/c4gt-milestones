## Learnings
Learnt about various methods to integrate buttons, rich text features. Researched over voice based subsitutes. Researched over methods to implement language detection effeciently. Also looked ovver ways to test the bot to avoid translation and transliteration errors.

## Feedback 
I was suggested to look into making it a voice-based function since users might find it easy to use. Was also suggested to try and generalise the bot framework so that it can be used multiple times.
