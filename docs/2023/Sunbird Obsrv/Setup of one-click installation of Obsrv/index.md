# Project Description

Adopters can use Sunbird Obsrv as a stand-alone building block or as a component of a system that makes use of additional Sunbird elements. To make it simple for adopters to quickly enable powerful data processing and aggregation infrastructure to process telemetry data, validate telemetry stream data, as well as aggregate and generate actionable insights via APIs, Sunbird Obsrv ships with a set of microservices, APIs, and some utility SDKs. Additionally, it features built-in open data publication and cataloguing capabilities. It is designed with extensibility in mind, giving users the freedom to customise the telemetry and tools for their own use-cases.
