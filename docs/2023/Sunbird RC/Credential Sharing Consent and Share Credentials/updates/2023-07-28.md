## Learnings

-   Learnt more about Angular routing, services and Auth Guard
-   My reviewer suggested that we could try make this whole implementation of CHAPI in a VC wallet into a npm module, so that any VC wallet can easily adopt it. They also suggested to add a few slides in my presentation to explain the audience certain topics like Verifiable Credentials and the CHAPI flow.
