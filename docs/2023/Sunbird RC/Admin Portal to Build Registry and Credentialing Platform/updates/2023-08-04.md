## Contributions

## Learnings
- Practiced working with the APIs and implementing logic in complex forms. Learned working with Reactive forms to build forms in angular. Reactive Forms provide a more structured and explicit way to handle form inputs and validations compared to Template-Driven Forms in Angular.
- Learned some of the key characteristics of reactive forms including Form Control, FormGroup, FormArray, FormBuilder and Dynamic Form Control Creation.
- Learned working with Formio.io in angular to create and manage forms. This library provides JavaScript powered forms for Angular. The benefits of this library include:
  - Renders a JSON schema as a webform and hooks up that form to the Form.io API's
  - Nested components, layouts, Date/Time, Select, Input Masks, and many more included features
  - Full JavaScript API SDK library on top of Form.io
