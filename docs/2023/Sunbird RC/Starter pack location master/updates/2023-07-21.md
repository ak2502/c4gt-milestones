During Week 3, significant progress was made in designing and implementing data models to support various hierarchies of Indian locations. Here are the key accomplishments:

## Milestones
- [x] Successfully designed and implemented data models for diverse hierarchies, including State > District > Subdistrict > Town / City / Village, drawing insights from commonly used standards like LGD, Wikipedia, and Post Office data.
- [x] Created well-structured schemas for essential entities such as State, District, Subdistrict, and others, establishing a solid foundation for the location registry.
- [x] Rigorously tested the Sunbird API integration with the newly developed schemas, ensuring seamless compatibility and robust data retrieval capabilities.
- [x] Overcame several challenges by effectively resolving critical bugs encountered during the initialization of the schemas, resulting in a more stable and efficient system.
