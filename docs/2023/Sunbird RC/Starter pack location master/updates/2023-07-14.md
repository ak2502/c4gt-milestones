[Location Registry Repository](https://github.com/anmode/demo-location-registry)

## Learnings
Continuing the practice of making regular commits each day proved to be a valuable learning experience. It not only fosters version control but also helps in tracking progress and managing code changes effectively. The iterative development process allows for quick feedback and ensures a steady pace of advancement in the project.

As the project moves forward, maintaining a consistent approach to version control and implementing agile development methodologies will be essential for achieving the best outcomes.
