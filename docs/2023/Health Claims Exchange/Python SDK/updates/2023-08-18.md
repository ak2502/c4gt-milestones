## Learnings

Leant the file structure of python libraries and how to make the SDK installable as a pyhton library. In rhe other half of the week, I searched various libraries such as `fhir.resources` to validate FHIR. However, none of those python library support HCX FHIR validation. I looked at `fhir.js` library to implement similar feature in python.
