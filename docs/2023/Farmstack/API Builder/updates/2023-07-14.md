## Learnings
1. **Project Refinement:** Learned how to refine and iterate on a project plan, incorporating feedback from mentors to enhance the project's scope and direction.
2. **Proof of Work (PoW) Concept:** Developed a proof of work, which is a crucial part of the project development process, helping to validate and verify key features before full implementation.
3. **Backend Foundation:** Gained expertise in setting up a robust backend infrastructure using Django to handle incoming POST requests and generate APIs.
4. **Frontend Design:** Explored the process of outlining the frontend design and user experience flow, ensuring a user-friendly interface for managing APIs.
