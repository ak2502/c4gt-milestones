## Milestones
- [x] Developing a automatic disaster recovery strategy using Barman on an AWS EC2 setup. Employed Ansible for configuring the EC2 instance, setting up Docker, and managing containers and recovery. 


## Contributions
- Draft PR [ add barman for docker platform #101 ](https://github.com/Samagra-Development/WarpSQL/pull/101) 

## Learnings
I learned how to use Terraform to handle EC2 instances and understood how Ansible works to create playbooks for easily setting up PostgreSQL and Barman containers. I also looked into things like PostgreSQL WAL streaming, effective backup recovery, and important measurements like Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO).
