## Milestones
- [X] Exploring various approaches for handling data persistence within Docker containers while constructing the disaster recovery solution for WarpSQL.
- [X] working on adding linters to github actions



## Contributions
- Draft PR [ add barman for docker platform #101 ](https://github.com/Samagra-Development/WarpSQL/pull/101) 
- [ add super-linter to repo #103 ](https://github.com/Samagra-Development/WarpSQL/pull/103)
## Learnings
I discovered the `super-linter` action and various linters for different programming languages. I also learned how to handle docker volumes using Terraform and how to keep Terraform states separate. Additionally, used `terraform workspace` to manage separate instances of infrastructure in a same directory.
