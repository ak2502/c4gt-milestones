## Contributions
Currently working on Creating a Dockerfile which we can use to create a container for our embedding API. Embedding API consists of 2 parameters and can be used only one of them at a time:-
1. query :- query asked by user.
2. text_corpus :- url to download csv file from where to add text embeddings to database.
