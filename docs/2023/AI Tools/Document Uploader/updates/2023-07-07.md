## Learnings
- [Looked out Mertics for Text segmentation and how to calculate them such as Pk value, WindowDiff, Precision and Recall.](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/text-segmentation-approaches-datasets-and-evaluation-metrics/)
- [Learned about text segmentation using Cosine similarty method.](https://medium.com/@npolovinkin/how-to-chunk-text-into-paragraphs-using-python-8ae66be38ea6)
- Learned a little bit about prompt engineering from my mentor to get our desired results from chatGPT.
