# Project Description
Our product [AmakrushAI](https://github.com/AmakrushAI) is a chatbot which solves query of farmer by giving them short and accurate answers. To achieve that we need to process data such that we can do query and find the data which is relevant to the user.
To accomplish this, My Project consists of 2 part :-
1. Chunking text into Meaningful text chunks given the text input (Text Segemntation)
2. Retriving chunk texts simillar to the query given by user (Information Retrival)
