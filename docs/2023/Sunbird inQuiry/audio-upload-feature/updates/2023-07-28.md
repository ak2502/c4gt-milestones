    Learned a lot from the review obtained in Midpoint showcase, the key points mentioned in the review were:
    1. Code comparison can be shown in projects dealing with refactor.
    2. We should think of extending the problem statement by implementing audio upload in other places apart from solutions.
    3. More Architectures can be involved.

Apart from this I learned about libraries like record-rtc and also learned a lot about there mechanism while implementing them.
