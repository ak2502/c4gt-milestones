## Learnings
How to navigate a codebase and work on it.
Here are some ways that I used while navigating through the codebase.
- [x] You do not need to understand the whole codebase and understanding the part of it on which you have to work is better.
- [x] Start from the top and sketch out the structure of a codebase and look through it with your mentor or the person who worked on it before.
- [x] I used chrome developer tools for debugging and inspecting the components and its very helpful in gaining insights of code's behaviour.
