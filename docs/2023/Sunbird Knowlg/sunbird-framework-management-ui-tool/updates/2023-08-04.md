## Learnings
1.Made the user interface look better by adding custom styles to the table and other elements.
2.Created a new button in each row of the table that allows you to delete that particular row.
3.Implemented a button for each row that, when clicked, shows detailed information about that row in a separate page.
4.On the "DetailsPage," data is fetched from the backend to show specific information based on the selected row.
5.Configured the application's navigation system so that when you click the "View" button, it takes you to the correct page with the details of the chosen row.
